# Storm Networks
_Welcome to the pinacle of unblocking and free web usage! Storm Networks has unblocked sites, true news, and more!_

## Our Mission
Our Mission is to provide helpful services to everyone! Students and children are often left out, but a new age is rising! Our goal is to let students read the news, play games and research, unbrideled by the shackles of censoreship. Welcome to the golden age of unblocking!
### Our sites
 - [Storm Networks](https://storm-networks.github.io/SN/) This is a non-fiction website where our devs add infomation about anything and everything. Submit a topic you want added in the chat, or at storm.networks.info@gmail.com.   
 - [Stormed Out](https://stormed-out.github.io/StormedOut/) This is where our devs share their opinions, projects and stories. It is easier to become a dev here, and you can send something in that you've wrote at stormed.out.ask@gmail.com, or put it in the chat.  

> Anytime you find a bug _please report it_ in the issues section of the github repository, and a dev should fix it soon after.
